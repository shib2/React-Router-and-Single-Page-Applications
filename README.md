This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

Assignment Requirements

This assignment requires you to complete the following tasks. Detailed instructions for each task are given below. The picture of the completed web page included below indicates the location within the web page that will be updated by the three tasks.

Task 1

In this task you will be integrating the AboutComponent into the single page application:

    First, download the AboutComponent.js given above and move it to the components folder, and
    Update the MainComponent.js file to integrate the AboutComponent into the single page application. You should be able to navigate to the AboutComponent by clicking the links in the navigation bar and the footer.

Task 2

In this task you will implement a new functional component named <RenderLeader> through the RenderLeader() function:

    The RenderLeader() function receives the details of a leader as its parameter,

    Implement RenderLeader() function to use the Leader information received as a parameter and render the leader information as shown in the screenshot below using the reactstrap <Media> component. Recall how we used the <Media> component in the first module to render the details of a dish in the MenuComponent.
    This will make available the <RenderLeader> component for use within your AboutComponent.

Task 3

In this task you will use the <RenderLeader> component created in the previous task to render a list of leaders within your AboutComponent:

    Update the leaders variable within the AboutComponent() function to make use of the <RenderLeader> component to render the list of leaders.
